# SEO-HTML-Refactor

## This a Project where I had to Refactor code

- The project was created in order to be able to consolidate code and refactor for better accessibility.
- With this challenge, by observing the HTML and CSS pages in conjunction, it will teach us how to find certain pieces of code quickly and understand what it does as a result.
- This allows the user to be able to navigate the code and manipulate it without having to search for long periods of time to find specific information.
- I learned how to search code and be able to consolidate certain pieces of code. That way there is not a lot of extra space being filled and I can easily access information.
- Refactoring saves a lot of time when searching for certain items of code.
